## About me ↓

Hi! I'm Jannis, a 12 year old programmer who loves to learn new stuff and code.
I started learning Python when I was 8 years old, and a few months ago I started learning Node and Express.

Some projects I'm working on right now:
- [teamcode](https://github.com/JannisKohle/teamcode): A chatting tool for teams
- [nuntius](https://github.com/JannisKohle/nuntius): A very great twitter clone

I like to ...
- code
- play drums
- build houses in Minecraft
- watch [Youtube](https://youtube.com)
- go to [Reddit](https://reddit.com)
- eat MüsliMitApfel
